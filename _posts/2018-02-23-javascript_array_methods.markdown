JavaScript has data structures called arrays and objects (similar hashes in Ruby), and you can operate on these data structures with different methods. There are subtle differences between common methods that might make your head spin if you don't understand the nitty gritty details.

Okay, enough spinning. This post will provide basic explanations for the following JavaScript methods: `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.find()`, and `reduce()`. 

## forEach()
This method executes a callback once for each element in the array. The return value is `undefined`, and this method changes original array. Let's say we had an array that contains ages for 5 people, and we want to add 10 years to each age in the array, but we aren 't concerned with getting the new array as a return value.  Let's use `forEach()`:

```javascript
let ages = [23, 26, 30, 33, 36];

ages.forEach(function(age) {
  console.log(age + 10);
});

//expected output 33
//expected output 36
//expected ouptut 40
//expected outpot 43
//expected output 46

> undefined
```
## map()
This method executes a callback function once for each element in an array and constructs a new array from the results. Because `map` actually alters the data in the array and returns that value,  it tends to be more commonly used than `forEach()`.  Let's apply `map()` to the same problem above and notice how how this method returns a new array.

```javascript
let ages = [23, 26, 30, 33, 36];

const agesInTenYears = peopleAges.map(age => age + 10)

console.log(agesInTenYears)

>Â [33, 36, 40, 43, 46]
```

## filter()
This method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. This is a great method for extracting elements based on a condition. Let's say we want to know which ages are greater or than or equal to 33. `filter()` will allow us to remove the ages that don't pass our test `(age >= 33)` and returns a new array with only the data we want.

```javascript
let ages = [23, 26, 30, 33, 36];

const overThirtyThree = age.filter(age => age >= 33)

console.log(overThirtyThree)

> [33, 36]
```
## find()
This method returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise undefined is returned. Let's say we want to return the first age below 26. We aren't concerned with returning all the ages below 26, but only the  **first** age that meets our conditon. Let's use `find()`.

```javascript 
let ages = [23, 24, 26, 30, 33, 36];

const earlyTwentiesAge = ages.find(function(age) {
	return age < 26;
});

console.log(earlyTwentiesAge)

> 23
```
## reduce()
This method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value. This is great a method for when you want to find a cumulative value based on elements across the array.  Let's switch gears and try to add all of the numbers in array of prices. `reduce()` works great for this scenario. 

```javascript
const prices = [25, 50, 10, 25, 500]

const addPrices = (accumulator, price) => accumulator + price;

console.log(prices.reduce(addPrices));

> 610
```

Note: You can also concatenate values with `reduce()`, and set the accumulator to whatever fits your needs.

When you want to manipulate data structures, these methods will help. **But remember**, `foreach` doesn't return a new array, so it can't chain with other methods.
