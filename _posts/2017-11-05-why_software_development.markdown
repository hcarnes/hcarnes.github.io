I am motivated by work that improves the lives of real people. I am happiest when I am immersed in learning. Last year, I learned VBA to increase my productivity in Excel and Outlook. During this experience, I learned about coding. I bought "Learn Ruby the Hard Way" and started learning more on my own. From there, I enrolled in Flatiron's online web development bootcamp. 

I have a lot of ideas about how technology could help nonprofits increase their impact, and I want to connect my ideas with coding skills. As much as I love a challenge, the decision to learn software development feels like a no-brainer.
