You don't _need_ JavaScript to implement a dropdown.

**You can create a dropdown using just the html `<details>` element.**

This post will cover how I implemented a dropdown menu for an app I recently created called [Congress Connect](https://github.com/hcarnes/congress_connect). I first learned about this element at a BrooklynJS meetup almost a year ago. There was a really cool talk (author and slides linked below) about `<details>`. The slides are excellent, and I highly recommend reading them if you are interested in learning more.

# How it works

To implement the dropdown, start with the `<details>` tag.

_According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details), the (`<details>`) creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label can be provided using the `<summary>` element._

Inside that, nest the `<summary>` tag, which holds the visible title of the information being viewed. Below that, include the content that you'd like to toggle. Here's an example:

```html
<details>
  <summary>Voting Record</summary>
  <p>
    Here is the information that shows after the summary element is clicked!
  </p>
</details>
```

## Here's a demo from Congress Connect

Here's a snippet of the code to give you another example:

```jsx
<>
  <details>
    <summary>Voting Record</summary>
    {member.roles
      .filter(x => x.congress === "116")
      .map(role => (
        <ul>
          <li>Bills sponsored: {role.bills_sponsored}</li>
          <li>Bills cosponsored: {role.bills_cosponsored}</li>
          <li>Missed votes: {role.missed_votes_pct}%</li>
          <li>Votes with party: {role.votes_with_party_pct}%</li>
        </ul>
      ))}
  </details>
</>
```
