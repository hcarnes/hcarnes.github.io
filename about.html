<p>I'm a full stack web developer based in Brooklyn. Before transitioning to software development, I worked in the nonprofit arena, specifically in fundraising and grant administration, through which I also gained project management experience. While I enjoyed supporting nonprofits, I saw an opportunity to make a greater positive impact through technology. Because of that experience, I enrolled in Flatiron Schoolâ€™s full-stack developer program, where I learned Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and React. My ultimate goal is to obtain a position at a company using technology to improve the lives of real people.I enjoy drawing, teaching, and learning.</p>
