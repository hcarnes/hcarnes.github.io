<p>I'm a web developer based in Brooklyn. Before transitioning to software development, I worked in the nonprofit arena, 
specifically in fundraising and grant administration, through which I also gained project management and technical writing experience. 
While I enjoyed supporting nonprofits, I saw an opportunity to make a greater positive impact through technology. I also enjoy drawing.</p>
