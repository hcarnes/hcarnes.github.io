<p>Full stack web developer with a passion for mission-driven work. After working with developers in my previous role, I discovered web development as an opportunity for me to leverage my creativity and analytical skill set. I have experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React, as well as project management and technical writing. I am motivated by using web development as a tool to improve outcomes at social impact organizations. I created the drawings found in my posts.</p>
