<p>I'm a developer living in Brooklyn. I'm experienced in Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. Before transitioning to software development, I worked in the nonprofit arena, 
specifically in fundraising and grant administration. Before that, I was a K-8th grade educator. While I learned a lot in previous roles, I saw an opportunity to make a greater positive impact through software development. I enjoy technical writing and drawing.</p>
