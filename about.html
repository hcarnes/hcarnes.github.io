<p>I'm a full stack web developer based in Brooklyn. While working in nonprofit grant administration, I discovered web development as an opportunity for me to leverage my creativity and analytical skill set. I have experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React, as well as project management and technical writing.</p>
