<p>I'm a budding ðŸŒ± developer living in Brooklyn. Before transitioning to software development, I worked in the nonprofit arena, 
specifically in fundraising and grant administration. While I enjoyed supporting nonprofits, I saw an opportunity to make a greater positive impact through technology. I enjoy technical writing and drawing.</p>
