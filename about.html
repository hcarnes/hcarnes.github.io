<p>I'm a developer living in Brooklyn. I'm experienced in Ruby, Rails and JavaScript. In my free time, I build apps with
  React. Before transitioning to software development, I worked in the nonprofit arena,
  specifically in fundraising and grant administration. Before that, I worked as a middle school art teacher for 2
  years. Through my work at nonprofits, I saw an opportunity to make a greater positive impact
  through software development and decided to learn how to program. I enjoy technical writing, drawing, and watching TV.
